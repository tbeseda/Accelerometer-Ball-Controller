Control a ball in a browser window from a mobile browser window that supports accelerometer APIs!

iOS 4.2+ brought accelerometer and gyroscope APIs to Mobile Safari.

@firt wrote up some of the APIs and included a cool demo: http://www.mobilexweb.com/blog/safari-ios-accelerometer-websockets-html5

I expanded on it with a pubnub.com account to push data from the device (controller.html) to the ball (index.html) on another machine!  
Neat :)
